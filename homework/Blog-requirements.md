# Blog Requirements

Writing blogs about technical topics specifically related to Cyber Security is something we at Jr. DevLeague believe is important. People have careers just writing blogs, but more importantly it is a way for students to practice writing about subjects covered in our Cyber Security course. All blogs should:

1. Be done through the students' account on https://medium.com/
2. Should be published and then slacked or turned in using the link 
3. Should have a creative title, a catchy introduction, and a conclusion
4. Should contain screenshots, and images whenever possible
5. Should contain links to outside resources and proper documentation of those outside resources


#### Example 1:
https://medium.com/@kameroncooks13/how-i-feel-about-the-cyber-competition-and-the-state-of-the-club-in-general-4002ce4137fc

(Bad - No paragraphs!, doesnt make sense, run-on sentences, gramatical errors)

#### Example 2:
https://medium.com/@kgelbard6113/kai-gelbard-924413e4a5e

(Bad- Very short, doesnt make sense, errors)

#### Example 3:
https://medium.com/@agreene0308/what-are-firewalls-97b48efbbba4

(Good - Nice pictures, layout, and content)

#### Example 4:
https://medium.com/@bridan20/the-worlds-biggest-doodoo-poopoo-mistake-in-cybersecurity-6df38b2870af

(Good - Creative title?, Well written, good siting of sources)
