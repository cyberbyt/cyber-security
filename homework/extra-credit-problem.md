### Extra Credit Math Problem:

A house was haunted by a combined total of 51 ghosts, goblins, and ghouls. On Friday there were half as many ghosts as there were goblins. On saturday, two-thirds of the ghouls each became a ghost. On Sunday 11 of the ghosts each becme a goblin and teh ratio of gouls to goblins became 1:3. If no other changes occured, how many ghosts are there?
