# Your Mission - Srehpic

You are an **u**ndercover spy for the United States government working on a secret proje**c**t to develop a new type of cipher. 
You must research the different types of Ciphers that we have talked about and that are historically relevant. 

Part 1: is to pick one cipher from this list and talk about the history of it, where it started, h**o**w it works, the good and bad, etc. Pick a cipher you do not **k**now anything about to research and write about!
- Enigma
- Morse Code
- Stegano**g**raphy
- Public / Private Key
- Substitution Ciphers
- Ciphers that use a shift
- Pictographic Ciphers 


Part 2: Create your own Cipher
Be creative! Do not use one of the ciphers you researched and rea**l**ly try to create your own. It can be pictures (include a screenshot if you **d**raw it out), numbers, letters, alien language, whatever! Make sure to include your cipher, key, and a message. 


Extra Credit: Decipher this!
