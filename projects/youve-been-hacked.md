## Youâ€™ve Been Hacked - Lesson Plan

### Date:
11/30/18

### Prerequisites:
- Some knowledge of Cyber Security 

### Activity:
You just started a job as a Network/Cyber Security administrator for a small company (about 15 employees). On Monday your employees complain that the internet is very slow so you decided to check your firewall logs to see if anything unusual has happened. You then notice a fishy looking download on some computer in the office (you don't know who's). You get a sinking feeling in your stomach because you know you have been hacked. What do you do?  

### Instructions
Write down in order, at least 10 things you would do immediately after finding out. Write down anything you would not do. Also write down what you do for future attacks.
