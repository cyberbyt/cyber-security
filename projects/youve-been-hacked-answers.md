### Some of My answers:
	- Unplug the system from the internet
  - Start capturing network traffic (wirshark or netwflow) 
	- Do Not Shut down the system because you will want to image the hard drive and see what the attacker did
	- Have the user Change passwords for accounts or block access
  - Monitor all outgoing traffic to see if attackers are exfiltrating data (Are there any weird ports open?)
  - Look on Virus total, Twitter, etc. to see if there is information about the attack out their already
  - Reach out to other contacts to see what they suggest
  - Notify the FBI and they will give you instructions for sending them the malware to look at 
	- Try and figure out what hackers are doing and what has been compromised
  - May need to let ther users in the office know what is going on. Definitely tell them to not open any suspicious emails
	- DO NOT upload the malware to virus total (the hackers who made the malware will be watching to see if their malware has been detected and may try to really quickly get more information out of your system)
  - Do not forward the email
  - After it has all happened, write down what you did, and the details (you will forget later)
  - Hopefully get to play around with the malware in a sandboxed environment
  - Come up with a plan for the future of how you will handle a cyber attack
